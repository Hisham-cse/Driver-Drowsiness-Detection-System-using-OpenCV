# Driver Drowsiness Detection System using OpenCV
 Driver drowsiness is a significant cause of road accidents, leading to severe injuries and fatalities. To mitigate this risk, we propose a Driver Drowsiness Detection System that utilizes computer vision techniques to monitor driver alertness in real-time. By leveraging OpenCV and Python, our system processes video input from a camera, analyzing facial features and eye movements to detect signs of fatigue. The system employs eye aspect ratio (EAR) and head position tracking to identify when the driver is becoming drowsy. Upon detecting drowsiness, the system triggers an alert to prompt the driver to take necessary action, such as taking a break. This solution aims to enhance road safety by providing an effective and non-intrusive method to monitor driver alertness and prevent accidents caused by drowsiness.
